# Python exercise to find which tag has the most get operations associated
## QUESTION
Create a function that takes an openAPI JSON document as input and produces a dictionary. The dictionary should map tags to a list of GET operationId that are tagged with that specific tag.

Other types of operations such as "post" or "delete" should not be considered. 

Read weather.json and use the output of get_tags_to_get_operations to find which tag has the most get operations associated and print it. 



Example

INPUT:
```
{
  "openapi": "3.0.0",
  "info": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "title": "Swagger Petstore",
    "license": {
      "name": "MIT"
    }
  },
  "paths": {
    "/pets": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "List all pets",
        "operationId": "listPets",
        "tags": [
          "pets"
        ],
        "parameters": [...],
        "responses": {...}
      }
    },
    "/owner": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "List all owners",
        "operationId": "listOwners",
        "tags": [
          "owner"
        ],
        "parameters": [...],
        "responses": {...}
      }
    },
    "/dogs": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "List all dogs",
        "operationId": "listDogs",
        "tags": [
          "pets"
        ],
        "parameters": [...],
        "responses": {...}
      }
    }
  },
  "components": {...}
}
```

OUTPUT:
```
{"pets": ["listPets", "listDogs"], "owner": ["listOwner"]}
```

## SOLUTION
Extract the tags associated with GET operations, and determine which tag has the most GET operations:

```python
import json

def get_tags_to_get_operations(data: dict) -> dict:
    tag_to_get_operations = {}

    for path, methods in data.get("paths", {}).items():
        if 'get' in methods:
            tags = methods['get'].get('tags', [])
            for tag in tags:
                if tag not in tag_to_get_operations:
                    tag_to_get_operations[tag] = []
                tag_to_get_operations[tag].append(path)
    
    return tag_to_get_operations

# Load the JSON data (replace with the actual path if needed)
with open('weather.json', 'r') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

# Get the tag to GET operations mapping
tag_to_operations = get_tags_to_get_operations(data)

# Find the tag with the most GET operations
max_tag = None
max_operations = 0

for tag, operations in tag_to_operations.items():
    if len(operations) > max_operations:
        max_operations = len(operations)
        max_tag = tag

print(f"Tag with most GET operations: {max_tag} with {max_operations} operations")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `get_tags_to_get_operations(data)`**:
   - Iterates through each path and its methods in the OpenAPI JSON document.
   - Checks if the method is a 'GET'.
   - Extracts the tags associated with the 'GET' method and maps them to the corresponding paths.

2. **Loading the JSON**:
   - Opens the `weather.json` file and loads its content into a Python dictionary.

3. **Determining the Tag with Most GET Operations**:
   - Iterates through the dictionary returned by `get_tags_to_get_operations`.
   - Tracks which tag has the most associated GET operations and prints it.

This code will read the JSON, process the data, and print the required result. Ensure the `weather.json` file is correctly placed in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to it.

### Complexity
The complexity of the solution can be analyzed in terms of both time and space:

#### Time Complexity
1. **Iterating through Paths and Methods:**
   - The outer loop iterates over all the paths in the JSON document.
   - For each path, the inner loop checks the methods associated with that path.
   - In the worst case, every path has a 'GET' method with tags.

   Let \( P \) be the number of paths and \( T \) be the average number of tags per 'GET' method.

   The time complexity for iterating through the paths and methods is \( O(P \times T) \).

2. **Building the Dictionary:**
   - For each path and its 'GET' method, we update the dictionary, which takes \( O(1) \) time on average for each insertion.

   Therefore, the overall time complexity for building the dictionary is \( O(P \times T) \).

3. **Finding the Tag with the Most GET Operations:**
   - After building the dictionary, we iterate over it to find the tag with the most operations.
   - If there are \( K \) unique tags, this operation takes \( O(K) \).

Combining these, the total time complexity is:
\[ O(P \times T + K) \]

#### Space Complexity
1. **Storage for the Dictionary:**
   - The dictionary `tag_to_get_operations` stores tags as keys and lists of paths as values.
   - In the worst case, every path has a unique tag, and each tag maps to one path.

   If there are \( P \) paths and \( K \) unique tags, the space complexity for storing the dictionary is \( O(P + K) \).

2. **Storage for the JSON Data:**
   - The JSON data is loaded into memory, and its size is proportional to the input size.

Combining these, the total space complexity is:
\[ O(P + K) \]

#### Summary
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(P \times T + K) \)
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(P + K) \)

These complexities ensure the solution is efficient in handling typical OpenAPI JSON documents, especially when the number of paths and tags are manageable.
